=head1 README

You can use perldoc to read this document: C<perldoc README>.

=head1 INSTALLATION

Prior to running the server/client you must install it. This document gives you
a very broad overview of the necessary steps, for detailed instructions refer
please to the L<INSTALL> file (f.i. via perldoc INSTALL).

=head2 Verify the package

Before you do anything with the downloaded package, verify the signature.

Download our GnuPG key from http://www.bsi.bund.de/produkte/dicop/download.htm
and then check the detachd signature with:

	gpg --verify Dicop-Server-3.00_87.tar.gz.asc

(replace 3.00_87 with the actual version you got)

If the signature does not verify ok, please notify us immidiately. B<DO NOT>
run perl Makefile.PL or anythign else nor install the package when the
signature cannot be verified ok. B<Your system might get compromised!>.

=head2 Steps for the first time install

0: Relax. Take a deep breath. Steady yourself. Take a sip of your favourite.
1: Decide what you want to install where. We recommend that you install the
   server onto one computer first and get it running there. Than install one
   client at the same machine to test it in conjunction with the server, than
   follow with clients on different machines.
2: Check that the server/client machines meet the requirements outlined below.
   If not, upgrade the software/OS (notably Perl) first.
3: Untar/ungzip the server package to an extra directory.
4: Make sure you are able to run the testsuite for the server successfully.
   You may need to install additional Perl modules to complete this step.
5: Configure the server by running ./setup - it will copy config and template
   files, create a user/group for it, setup an admin account etc. for you
6: If you got additional worker files, add them to the server under worker/.
6: Run the server and administer it trough a browser to get familiar with it.
7: Untar/ungzip the client package to a separate directory and run it from
   there.
8: Copy the client to another machine and run it from there. Alternatively,
   mount the client directory on the server (via NFS/Samba whatever) and run
   the client from there.
9: Enjoy ;)

For further information, please see C<INSTALL>.

=head2 Requirements

You will need Perl v5.8.3 or better, preferable Perl v5.8.6, to run the server.

The client needs only Perl v5.6.x (for Windows use ActiveState Perl from
http://www.activestate.com).

The cgi-bin version C<server> exists no longer, you need to use the daemon
version C<dicopd> to run a server.

You also need an HTTP or FTP server to serve the clients with files.

The actual file server can run on a different machine. However, it is easier
to run the file server on the same machine than the DiCoP server, since it can
then access and serve the worker files from the DiCoP worker and target
directories directly, which saves you from syncing these directories.

=item daemon

When the daemon is running, you can connect to it via a web browser by using
http://127.0.0.1:8888/ and it should return the main page.

=back

If the daemon is running at another machine, simple connect to it
like you would connect to any other web browser, by using the correct IP and
port.

You can use the perl documentation utility perldoc to get more information. The
documentation is located in the subdirectory C<doc/>. Use C<perldoc pod/dicop>,
C<perldoc pod/client> or C<perldoc pod/server> to read more.


=head2 Hardware

The machine to run the server should have at least 64 MB (no X-Windows) or
128 MB (with X-Windows), so that no swapping occurs. A 200 Mhz x86 CPU does just
fine for a couple hundred clients, although having one or more Ghz and a
GigaByte or two RAM never hurt ;)


=head2 Supported platforms

The server was tested successfully under the following platforms:
